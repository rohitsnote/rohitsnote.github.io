<h2>O Moon!</h2>

O moon!watch me amass the shooting stars...
In cool wind and cloudy sky,twinkling and glowing and bright and shy!

I know you have so many of them!
Can u not send me the same?

I see already-you make them fall;
And yet each night u have them all!

Although I wait for you every night, 
 But the little stars, too catch my sight.

Little by little you go missing; little by little you come back;
Do the "missing you" are sprinkled as stars and then, o moon ,do you lump back?

Look there,o moon! A shooting star-
But I won't get it even though its not far.

Why? Don't you see those floating clouds?
Nigh are they sailing to you ,to crowd.

Most of them are very small for you;
But the larger one will cover your view.

I wish we converse without any pause,
So please listen to what follows:

Stream down to me as stars on earth.
Overflow through the land filled with mirth!

Handily I will gather some stars from the stream;
And lump you back into moon like a dream!

And still ,in stream, not a star will be less,be less,
Because I know the starstream never dries..

Then I need not keep the stars in toy carton,
Or  I need not find old sack when its done.

In case all this can be done and you agree;
You'll save hardwork that keeps me busy.

Then we will have lots of time to talk-
About my comb, long hair and my lovely frock!

Also I will ask about your painful scars,
And feel your pain from your answers.

But ,o moon, why you never say a word ?
And stare me smiling like I'm a chirping bird.

Once you come, I'll teach you to speak;
And teach you almost anything that you pick.

In the spare time,I'll show you coloured rocks;
And paint your stars with my colourful chalks.

Moreover, below the clouds we will enjoy the rain.
Oh!Clouds will  hide you again and again.

Here you hide ,here I seek but now I am sleepy and will go to sleep;
But next time you hide I'll not seek as you'll be seen after night goes deep.

O moon,among  the clouds still you look nice,
Keep on thinking tonight on my wise advice.
But don't you stay up beyond sunrise.
See you again ,good bye!Good night.
