One fine dawn,
Sun has came and gone-
Beyond the clouds,
Dark and thundering louds.

That early morning
Every flower was yearning.
Looking up at sky;
For rain to fall in their eyes.

That scene was beautiful,
As if that day was yule;
But something was wrong,
A flower was out of that song.

I asked that rose ,
“Why are you so sad?
Why don’t you want,
to be very glad?
On this rainy day;
In the happiest way.

Looking sadly at earth,
The red rose answered,
“I am missing my friend.
How can I play?
Even in this rain-
At the end of May”.

I looked beside ,
A flower was plucked off.
I knew it was stolen,
As the stem’s end was rough.

I asked her,”Who has stolen,
Your friend from you?”
“A very mad lover
to treat his love flu”
As she replied,she also cried.
I could not see that flower so upset.
Helplessly I moved by,
Thinking what should I do.
