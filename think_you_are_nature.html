You are a flower ,
Not selfish like humans,
You share your smell faster,
And vaster than rumours.
You donâ€™t limit your perfume inside you,
You distribute it among much more than few.

You are a fruit,
Not bitter like humans,
Sweeter than honey,
Sourer than lemons.

You are a plant,
Not moving like humans,
Fixed at a place;
Yet running lives in rhythms.

You are a huge tree
Not small-hearted like humans,
Neither weak like them.
While standing still,
You keep your surroundings
cool and sheltered.
While burning
you keep surroundings,
warm and lighted.
