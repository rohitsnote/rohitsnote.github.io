Strange it is but not untrue,
Light has its own speed too,
It too has to travel distances,
It also loses time in doing so.

Just imagine,in this infinite space,
Faraway a star is born,
Light is scattered out throughout,
Light rays are set into journey anew.

Suppose some rays travel unobstructed,
Until they are reflected into our eyes,
Then it shines out of our eyes,
And shows a twinkling dot in the sky.

Think it happens as it can be,
That time lost by rays to reach our eyes-
Happens to be the same-
In which star burnt away to merge into the dark.

In which case, star we’re watching,
Is just an illusion of time.
To die and light its world after death-
Is in nutshell, a life of star.

It burnt and blew out in obscurity,
Spent its life in silence.
But its light waves still vibrates throughout space,
This endless influence is a new verse.

Burnt itself to light the space.
Spent its life silently,
When we heard that silence,
That reached our eyes through the space?

We never knew and never will-
From this far, how can we recognise?
What part is played by the star?
This is known only to its nearest planets.

Farness is the cause of illusion of size.
Farness is the cause of illusion of time.
Isn’t the star innocent about this?
If we don’t get the greatness of its sacrifice.
