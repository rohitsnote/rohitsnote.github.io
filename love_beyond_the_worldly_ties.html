<h2>Love Beyond the Wordly Ties</h2>

From attachment, fallacious desires arise;
Eventually desires lead to vice.
To think of desires to be love is unwise;
For this is how peace is jeopardized.
Bitter or sweet, the truth is precise:
Selfless is love, selfishness otherwise.
How strange are the worldly ties,
Broken by the truth, bound by lies!
