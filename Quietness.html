<h2>I am Lost</h2>

Today, I am feeling light,
I really don't know-why?
But surely I am
Neither happy nor sad.

I am not aware,
Of whatever I should care,
As I don't know the cost,
Of whatever I have lost.

Presently, I'm bemused,
Bewildered and amused;
Always thinking of the loss,
Giggling, mewling less cause.

I wonder various ways,
To which my loss compares-
Has a bird lost her wing?
Or has she just paused singing?

Have the clouds lost their rain?
Have the ponds dried up again?
Or rain did fall but ponds are dry?
Where on the earth did raindrops die?

Its not at all like any loss before,
Whether its good-I am not sure,
Even if its not-I need no cure.
Whatever I have lost, I need no more.

So strange it is to lose something,
To feel the hollow, in heart, growing;
Heart lightens,feelings are high!
Soul brightens, I deeply sigh!

If you want to experience this,
I may help you, fulfilling your wish;
Take away from me this 'lost' memory,
I will like losing it, to you, for free.
