<h2>To the Joyous Blossom</h2>

O joyous blossom in the garden of lives;
Are you aware of the reach of your delights?

Once I had fate to be with you;
Amid little times, thousand memories grew.
Since then down my memory lanes,
Leaves are green and spring continues.

Smelling those memories with deepest sighs;
A lonely little bird joyfully sings and flies.
Often during day it gets lost in its way;
But at night, to your alluring radiance, it nighs.

Almost like dreams, again and again:
I wonder your ways to my memory lane.
Unable to unwind these mysteries of my mind,
I am bound to ask you then:

O joyous blossom in the garden of lives;
Are you aware of the reach of your delights?
