<h2>Monsoon winds</h2>

After hot and sunny days,
Through the sun’s blazing rays,
Monsoon winds make their ways,
To the land–
Dry which lays.

Though they too are warmed by sun,
Over the fields when they boldly run,
It’s soothing to the green’s burn,
But late for them-
Yellow which turn.

They carry a very cool message,
As clouds assemble below sun’s rage,
Thunders bolt when they engage,
Then first shower-
Prisons all- in its trance cage.

Following this it’s a lot more fun,
Till everything’s filled, everyone’s done,
Soon the “hopeful” dark clouds –
Start seeming to be evil one.

For few days that remains the case,
Gradually cursed rain falls very less,
When all water is over-
Monsoon winds retreat to the ocean ways.

Those lands that were left in drought,
Life there, cried in pain.
Others that were fully drowned,
People there, cursed the rain.

Nature remained in liberty,
Following its laws,
Monsoon winds did their duty-
Without any pause.

Now leaves will wilt to fall,
As if discouraged by the retreat.
But before next monsoon’s call,
They’ll be ready to give them greet.
